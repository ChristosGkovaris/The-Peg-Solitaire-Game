# Peg Solitaire Game

Welcome to the "Peg Solitaire Game", a classic single-player puzzle game implemented in Python. The goal is to remove pegs from the board by jumping over them, leaving only one peg remaining.

## Game Instructions
- **Objective:** Reduce the number of pegs on the board by jumping over them, ideally leaving only one peg.
- **How to Play:** The game begins with a board setup containing pegs ('1') and empty spaces ('0'). 
  Enter the position of the peg you want to move followed by the direction (L for left, R for right, U for up, D for down). 
  Valid moves involve jumping over a peg into an empty space, which removes the jumped peg. 
  Continue playing until no more valid moves are possible. 
- **Game End:** The game ends when there are no valid moves left. The fewer pegs remaining, the better your performance.


## Implementation Details
- The game is implemented in Python as a command-line interface.
- The board is represented as a 2D list, with the initial configuration matching the traditional English peg solitaire layout.
- The game logic includes functions to handle user input, validate moves, and update the game state.
